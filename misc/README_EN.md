[‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/Bistutu/FluentRead) | English

Fluent Read is a highly efficient browser translation plugin that can translate text on web pages into any language. It is convenient, fast, and intuitive, and is powered by an artificial intelligence engine.

Fluent Read is written using TypeScript + [Vue3](https://cn.vuejs.org/) + [Element-Plus](https://element-plus.org/) + [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) frameworks, and supports compilation into plugins installable on most browsers.

# Features

1. Multiple translation methods:
   - Key shortcut translation: Hover the mouse over the text and press the designated shortcut key to translate.
   - Slide translation: Hold down the shortcut key and slide the mouse to select the text area you want to translate.

2. Supports caching and back translation:
   - To avoid re-translating sentences and reduce request counts, Fluent Read caches translations on each page. You don't need to worry about the details (blue indicates normal translation, green indicates cached translation). When using cached translations, no network request occurs.

   - Hovering the mouse over translated text and pressing the shortcut key triggers the **back translation feature**.

# FAQ

<details>
    <summary>1. How do I obtain a token?</summary>
    If you want to get a token for translation services, it's recommended to search on Baidu or Google with keywords like <code>model name + API</code>.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>2. Can someone steal my token?</summary>
    No. Fluent Read stores all your tokens locally in the browser, so no third party, including us, can steal your token data.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>3. Can my data be intercepted by others?</summary>
  No. Fluent Read does not collect your data. All your translation requests are directly forwarded to the translation service provider, so no intermediary can access your translation records.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>4. Why might the translation be inaccurate?</summary>
    There are many reasons why translations might be inaccurate. First, the translation engine might not fully understand the context and subtle language nuances of the original text. Secondly, different languages have different grammatical structures and expressions, which can make it difficult to retain the full meaning of the original text when translated directly. <strong>It is suggested to try other models.</strong>
